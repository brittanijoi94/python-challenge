# python-challenge

In this python challenge we had to analyze data from two different scdenarios; Pybank and Pypoll.

For the Pybank challenge we were given a budget dataset and had to calculate each of the following using everything that we learned from the python unit:

The total number of months included in the dataset


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

For the Pypoll challenge we were given an election dataset and had to analyze the votes and calculate the following:

The total number of votes cast


A complete list of candidates who received votes


The percentage of votes each candidate won


The total number of votes each candidate won


The winner of the election based on popular vote.

I finally learned how to commit my changes using the terminal so I was able to do commits throughout working on my code which made me extremely happy!
